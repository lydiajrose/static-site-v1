    <h2>The Beginning of Digital Literacy</h2>
    <p>From the age of two I was addicted to video games.
      It was almost second nature for me to watch as my brother
      blazed through side scrollers, unlocked every character and
      stage of his fighter games, and beat every computer player
      he came across. On the occasions he let me play with him,
      I was always fumbling around trying to do any basic moves in
      each new game and on each new console. Though I was never able
      to beat my brother, I was usually able to competently play
      each game after a couple tries.</p>
    <p>It wasn't really until I was in middle school that I got
      hands on experience using typical PC software like Word,
      Microsoft Paint, Powerpoint, etc. and it was the skills that
      I learned while playing video games with my brother that
      allowed me to adapt to these new technologies more quickly
      than I would have otherwise. It might have also helped that
      I could always ask my electrical-engineer father for help if
      I had any questions. If  anything, that is one of the greatest
      skills I've learned: how to find people who can help you and
      how to ask them for help.</p>
    <p>I saw this particularly at my internship at Best Buy. You
      always have to learn new technologies at every job, but it's
      always difficult when you're trying to document technologies
      that you have no experience using. Not only do you need to
      toy the technology itself, you have to ask a lot of questions
      and do some outside research on your own in order to make
      the best material you can.</p>

    <h2>Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
    <p>Since middle school, I've become more adept at using the
      longer lasting technologies that I began to learn at that
      time. I've also dabbled in programming in going from a
      Computer Science major to a Technical Writing major and have
      had the opportunity to take classes and participate in
      internships that taught me new programs such as Adobe
      software, WordPress, and GitHub. I am constantly learning
      new technologies and I doubt that will change any time soon.</p>
